# 🕵️‍♂️ Email Recon Awareness Tool

This project simulates how unclaimed or reused email addresses can be hijacked across platforms—raising awareness about credential hygiene and digital identity risks.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Checks if an email is available on Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook
- Probes social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter) for linked accounts
- Flags breach status using public APIs (EmailRep, HaveIBeenPwned)
- Outputs a risk report showing potential hijack vectors

## ⚠️ Why It Matters

Most people don’t realize:
- Their old or unused emails may still be tied to active accounts
- If those emails are unclaimed, attackers can register them and reset passwords
- This tool demonstrates the risk—ethically and educationally

cd ~
rm -rf email-recon-awareness  # delete old folder
